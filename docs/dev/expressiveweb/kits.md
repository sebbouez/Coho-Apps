# Expressive Web Kits

In Expressive Web, you can consider a Kit like an SDK.  
It contains all information (scripts, config...) to configure the editor.

Expressive Web is like an IDE. It will use the Kit configuration to show options and features that fit the capabilities of the Kit.

This way, Expressive Web can easily be used to create websites using Vanilla mode, Boostrap framework, Tailwind CSS UI...  
The Kits are easy to create and to extend. So you can even create your own Kits.
