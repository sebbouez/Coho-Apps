# Expressive Web

Expressive Web is a free software to build static websites using WYSIWYG blocks.  
It is written in .NET using Avalonia UI, so it should work correctly on the following systems: Windows, Linux, MacOS.

## History

Expressive Web was created to be a successor of PageFabric, a free WYSIWYG website builder for Windows only written in WPF.

## Vision

The project is in a very early stage of development.  
Differences with PageFabric are:

* No proprietary page format : use only pure HTML so you can edit them with another application if needed
* Not tied to one framework : use default one, Bootstrap,...
* Web references (aka packages in PageFabric) are no longer stored on proprietary servers, we now use JsDeliver, so you can download any package and use it already

The goal is to be able to work with several kits (Bootstrap,...).  
The user can use the visual designer to place predefined constructions or unit components.

## Extensibility

Provide a way to extend the designer with custom components.  
Also be able to work with content (translate segment, replace image...).  
Open the path to AI extensions.
