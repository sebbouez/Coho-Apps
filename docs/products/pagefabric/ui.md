If you regularly use Microsoft Office or web browsers, you'll feel like home here.  
* Opened pages are displayed on top of the window, in tabs, like almost all web browsers today.
* Features are organized by category in a ribbon, like in Microsoft Office.

You can quickly show panels or activate commands using [shortcuts](shortcuts.md).  

If you prefer a dark theme, you can go to **File &gt; Application settings &gt; General** and check the Dark theme checkbox.
